<p style="font-size:100%;">Volunteering is not only about aiding others. It offers so much more. Through volunteering, I learned valuable community and social skills, and well as gained valuable work experience.<br> I learned how to work with children, the elderly, and those with special needs.<br>In addition, I learned what it is like to have a job and responsibilities. Volunteering has played in a significant role in the shaping of who I am today.</p>
