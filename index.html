<li>“Whatever you do, do it with purpose. Being focused is not something to be ashamed of. It is something to be proud of. <br>When you know what are you are doing and have a clear vision of where you are going, you will not need to chase opportunities. Opportunities will seek you. Happiness will chase you. And, instead of being a choice, you will be the one choosing.”<br>
― Najwa Zebian, Mind Platter</li>
